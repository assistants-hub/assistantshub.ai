# Contributing to Assistants Hub

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Assistants Hub! It's people like you that make Assistants Hub such a great tool. We welcome contributions from everyone as part of our mission to democratize AI assistant development. Here are some guidelines that we ask contributors to follow to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

    - Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce it.
    - If it's a new feature, explain why you think it would be a good addition to Assistants Hub.
- Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    - This is usually the main branch.
    - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
    - To quickly create a topic branch: `git checkout -b my_fix_branch main`.
- Make commits of logical and atomic units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
    - Start the commit message with a short summary (50 characters or less).
    - Provide a detailed description if necessary. Use markdown syntax in the description.
- Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
- Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
